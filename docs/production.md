## Security Checklist
Follow the recommendations in [Security Best Practices](security.md). Ensure all
traffic uses HTTPS and validate every request against the protocol schema.

## Monitoring
Collect metrics such as request latency and error rates. Tools like Prometheus
and Grafana integrate well with the architecture described in
[Architecture guide](architecture.md).
