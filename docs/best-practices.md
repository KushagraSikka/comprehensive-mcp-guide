## Coding Guidelines
Following common patterns keeps MCP services consistent across languages.
Use descriptive method names, validate parameters, and return clear error
responses. Refer to the [Protocol Spec](api-reference/protocol-spec.md) for the
expected JSON-RPC shapes.

## Deployment Tips
When running in production you should implement health checks and structured
logging. The [Architecture guide](architecture.md) explains the runtime
components while the [Security guide](security.md) highlights authentication
strategies.
