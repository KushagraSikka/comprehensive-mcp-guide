# üèóÔ∏è MCP Architecture Deep Dive

This section describes how the core components of MCP interact and how JSON-RPC requests flow through the system.

For instructions on running a local server read the [Getting Started guide](getting-started.md).

## Components
- **Client** ‚Äì Sends JSON-RPC requests to the server.
- **Server** ‚Äì Receives requests and dispatches them to handlers.
- **Transport** ‚Äì HTTP is common, but WebSocket or other transports can be used.

## JSON-RPC Flow
1. A client sends a request like the following:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "sum",
  "params": [1, 2],
  "id": 42
}
```
2. The server validates the request.
3. The appropriate handler is executed.
4. The result is encoded back into JSON-RPC format and returned.
