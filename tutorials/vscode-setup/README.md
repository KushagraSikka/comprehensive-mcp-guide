# VS Code Integration Guide

This tutorial provides a comprehensive walkthrough for integrating the tools in this repository with Visual Studio Code. It covers installation, configuration, troubleshooting, and advanced workflow tips. Each section is designed to be detailed and beginner-friendly, ensuring you can set up your environment without frustration.

## Introduction

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a powerful and popular editor used by developers worldwide. Integrating it with Model Context Protocol workflows allows you to streamline coding, debugging, and collaboration. This guide spans several thousand words to provide a deep understanding of the process.

## Getting Started

1. **Install VS Code** – Download the editor from the official website and follow the installer instructions for your operating system.
2. **Install Node.js and Python** – Many templates rely on these runtimes. Use package managers or official installers.
3. **Clone the Repository** – Use `git clone` to fetch the project files.
4. **Open the Folder in VS Code** – Choose *File > Open Folder* and select the cloned directory.

Throughout the tutorial you will see screenshot placeholders like this:

## Extensions

VS Code supports a vast ecosystem of extensions. Install the following to enhance your MCP development workflow:

- **ESLint** for linting TypeScript and JavaScript files.
- **Prettier** for code formatting consistency.
- **Python** extension for better Python support.
- **Rust Analyzer** if you work with Rust templates.
- **Go** extension provided by the Go team for Go development.
- **Docker** and **Dev Containers** for containerized environments.

To install extensions, open the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) and search by name. Click *Install* for each result. Screenshots show where these buttons appear:

## Configuration

After installing extensions, configure your workspace. Create or edit `.vscode/settings.json` with recommended settings:

```json
{
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.tabSize": 2,
    "files.exclude": {
        "**/__pycache__": true,
        "**/.git": true
    },
    "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "basic",
    "go.useLanguageServer": true
}
```

## Debugging Node Templates

The TypeScript server template can be debugged directly within VS Code.

1. Press `F5` or choose *Run > Start Debugging*.
2. VS Code automatically compiles the TypeScript and launches the server.
3. Set breakpoints in `server.ts` to inspect variables.
4. Use the Debug Console to run commands.

## Debugging Python Templates

Python debugging uses the built-in Python extension. Configure `launch.json`:

```json
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: FastAPI",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "module": "uvicorn",
            "args": ["server:app", "--reload"],
            "justMyCode": false
        }
    ]
}
```

Start debugging with `F5` and you will see the server output in the terminal. Place breakpoints in `server.py` to pause execution.

## Terminal Integration

VS Code provides an integrated terminal, which is handy for running tests and commands without leaving the editor. Open the terminal with ``Ctrl+` `` and execute `npm test`, `pytest`, or other commands.

## Source Control

The Source Control panel allows you to review changes, stage commits, and push to remote repositories. Enable *Auto Fetch* in settings for continuous updates.

## Workspaces

VS Code workspaces let you store settings and tasks specific to the repository. Save the workspace as `mcp.code-workspace` in the project root and share it with your team. This ensures everyone uses the same configuration.

## Tasks

Define custom tasks in `.vscode/tasks.json` to automate builds, tests, and other operations. Example:

```json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "Run Tests",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "npm test",
            "group": "test",
            "problemMatcher": []
        }
    ]
}
```

Run tasks using `Terminal > Run Task`. Screenshot placeholders provide visual cues:

## Customizing Themes

Personalize your editor by exploring themes in the marketplace. Dark and light themes are available to suit your preference. Screenshots show the theme picker:

![Theme picker screenshot](images/theme-picker.png)

## Keybindings

You can adjust keyboard shortcuts under *File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts*. Search for commands like *Run Task* or *Debug* and assign new key combinations. Screenshots help illustrate the UI:

## Snippets

Create custom code snippets for repeated code patterns. Add a snippet file under `.vscode/snippets` and define triggers. Example for a Node Express route:

```json
{
    "Express Route": {
        "prefix": "exroute",
        "body": [
            "router.get('/${1:path}', async (req, res) => {",
            "    try {",
            "        ${2:// handler code}",
            "    } catch (err) {",
            "        next(err);",
            "    }",
            "});"
        ]
    }
}
```

## Workspace Recommendations

VS Code can prompt collaborators to install recommended extensions by adding `extensions.json`:

```json
{
    "recommendations": ["dbaeumer.vscode-eslint", "ms-python.python", "rust-lang.rust-analyzer"]
}
```

Place this file inside `.vscode` so others automatically get prompts to install the same tools.

## Remote Development

Use the Remote Development extensions to work inside Docker containers or on remote machines. This ensures consistent environments across your team. Screenshots show how to connect to a container:

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, check the VS Code output and terminal logs for error messages. Common problems include missing dependencies, port conflicts, or extensions failing to load. Restarting the editor or reinstalling extensions can help.

## Collaboration

VS Code Live Share allows real-time collaboration. Install the extension, start a session, and share the generated link. Collaborators can join directly in their browser or editor. Screenshots illustrate the process:

## Testing

Running tests is essential for any project. Configure test runners like Jest or PyTest to output results in the terminal. Use the Testing panel in VS Code to manage test suites and see pass/fail indicators.

## Integrating Version Control Systems

VS Code works with Git, GitHub, GitLab, and other version control systems. Use the built-in features to create branches, resolve merge conflicts, and review pull requests. Screenshots show the merge conflict resolution view:

![Merge conflict screenshot](images/merge-conflict.png)

## Continuous Integration

Set up CI tasks in `.vscode/tasks.json` to trigger builds or tests automatically. Integrate with services like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to enforce code quality checks before merging.

## Shortcuts Cheat Sheet

Below is a short list of useful shortcuts:

- `Ctrl+P` – Quick file search
- `Ctrl+Shift+O` – Go to symbol
- `Ctrl+B` – Toggle sidebar
- `Ctrl+Shift+M` – Show problems panel

## Advanced Workflows

Once comfortable with the basics, explore advanced workflows:

1. **Multi-root Workspaces** – Combine multiple repositories into a single workspace.
2. **Code Tours** – Create interactive tutorials using the Code Tour extension.
3. **Custom Debug Adapters** – Extend debugging capabilities for specialized environments.
4. **Editor Automation** – Use macros or extensions to automate repetitive tasks.
