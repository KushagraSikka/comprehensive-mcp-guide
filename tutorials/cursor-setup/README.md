# Cursor IDE Setup and Configuration

This tutorial explores how to configure the Cursor IDE for efficient development. It spans numerous sections covering installation, workspace management, extension usage, and troubleshooting. Screen captures are referenced as placeholders throughout the guide to illustrate steps.

## Overview

Cursor is a specialized IDE designed to enhance coding productivity. Integrating it with your projects ensures better navigation, code intelligence, and version control. The following paragraphs dive deeply into all aspects of Cursor setup so you can hit the ground running.

## Installation

1. Visit the official Cursor website and download the installer for your platform.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

## Extensions

Cursor supports various extensions to extend its functionality. Navigate to the Extensions view, search for packages like *Code Formatter* or *Git Integration*, and install them.

## Configuration File

Cursor stores settings in a `cursor.json` file within each workspace. Example:

```json
{
    "theme": "dark",
    "formatter": "prettier",
    "lintOnSave": true
}
```

Customize this file to fit your preferences. A screenshot placeholder illustrates the settings editor:

## Source Control Integration

Cursor integrates seamlessly with Git. Clone repositories, create branches, and commit changes directly from the interface. Use the Source Control panel to stage files and push to remote hosts.

## Debugging

Set breakpoints in your code and run debug configurations. Cursor provides an intuitive debug console and variable inspector. A screenshot placeholder shows debugging in action:

## Terminal Usage

An embedded terminal allows you to run commands without leaving the IDE. Launch it via the menu or with a keyboard shortcut. This is useful for running tests or executing scripts.

## Keybindings

Cursor lets you redefine keybindings to match your habits. Open the Keybindings editor and search for actions to customize.

## Snippets

Reusable snippets save time. Define them in the Snippets manager and trigger them with short phrases while coding.

## Performance Tips

- Close unused tabs to free memory.
- Use the built-in profiler to identify slow plugins.
- Enable autosave to reduce the risk of losing work.

## Collaboration Features

Cursor offers live collaboration so you can share sessions with teammates. Start a collaboration session and send the invite link.

## Troubleshooting

If an extension fails to load or the IDE behaves unexpectedly, check the logs in the Help menu. Reinstalling or disabling conflicting extensions can resolve many issues.
